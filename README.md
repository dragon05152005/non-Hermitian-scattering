scattering approaches to non-Hermitian topological pumping

This is one joint project in collabration with Wenchao Hu, Yidong Chong and Longwen Zhou.
(1) The project is initiated by Wenchao's numerical exploration of 2D network model with balanced gain and loss. The eigenvalues of the scattering matrix for Hermitian case is confined on the complex unit circle. If balanced gain and loss is introduced to the system, the scattering matrix eigenvalues will continued to the complex plane. For small size system, the two eigenvalues form two dis-connected closed loops in general. If the non-Hermiticity increases, two closed loops join with each other. And further increasing non-Hermiticity, the joined loop dis-connected again, and winding behaviour emerges.
(2) Later I joined in the discussion and found that the interesting behaviour of scattering matrix eigenvalues indeed is one typical feature of exceptional point in non-Hermitian system. 
(3) Yidong later suggest exploration in systems, such as Hamiltonian systems. 
(4) I extend the theoretical study to lattice model, and explore the scattering approach in tight-binding lattice model, i.e., Haldane model. And I found that the excetiona point physics is quite general. Same physics exists in static Hamiltonian system.
(5) I extablished the direct connection between scattering theory and the spectrum of isolated system. The exceptional point related physics is quite general, and can be explained by level repulsion theory.
